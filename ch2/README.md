# Chapter 2 - Refactor the Game

In this chapter, we begin refactoring what we wrote in chapter 1 using two approaches:

 * Extracting attributes into a Module to mixin
 * Creating a parent class to inherit from

Ruby concepts covered in this chapter:

 * Modules (include, extend)
 * Class inheritence
