# FightSim - code to teach game developers Ruby

Recently, I was given the opportunity to teach Ruby concepts to former game
developers.  As a means of conveying these concepts, I put together a lesson plan
that used game development concepts to drive the conversations.

This approach proved very effective, and so I am now taking the concepts and code
and releasing it in individual chapters within this repo.  Take a look at the 
code and corresponding README for more information.
